      The land is rotten. Pointless wars are fought for throwaway barons and lords. The royal family, once powerful, is now a shell. A facade. A relic of a long dead realm. Hopelessness was the fate of many. But the breath of life occurred. A new land was discovered. An entire continent across the 4 Oceans. The first settlers returned with wealth, magic, and histories never before seen! The nobles tried to suppress the news, but that only increased the wild speculations of what wonders may lie in the new world. A mass exodus began, thousands of people began the perilous 7 month journey across the seas to discover this new world, and build themselves a new life full of opportunity in this strange place. Where will you go? What will you discover? What treasures and secrets will you find? What new dangers await? No limitations, aside from the land being new and not mapped.

      For 700 years, the Starfists have ruled Euriniam, the continent of 1000 cultures. It is vast and wide, encompassing the Granel Tundras to the north, to the Desolate Sands of the east, to the Borobombito Rainforests to the south. Long is the reach of the Starfists, and at the dawn of the Starnium Empire there was peace and prosperity. Cultures celebrated, diversity applauded, unity amongst all. Now, generations of inbreeding amongst the Starfists, and the greed of local lords and ministers, have ravaged Euriniam of natural beauty and the cooperation of its peoples. The Empire corrupts, destroys, and moves on wherever its gaze falls. Forests laid barren, fields scorched, and the common person finds themselves in daily fear of when the next power hungry individual will use their town as the next battlefield.

      Chief unto the disasters and calamities is the Vivos Trading Company, whose director Vivi is well known to be in bed with the current King; Garlton Starfist. With the monarchy bent around her finger, the Vivosians have ravaged Euriniam. About 6 months ago, a sailor by the name of Roger Karden returned after 12 years at sea. He and his crew told tale of a new world with wonders, riches, and opportunity beyond counting. Aboard his ship he had several large boulders of platinum, the skins of never before seen beasts, and preserves of plants unknown to even the wisest of the Druid Clans. Roger promised that this was only the beginning, that they had only been ashore for a few weeks before they got all they could safely transport, and they know of mountains and rivers full of these riches.

      Fearing a disruption of power, under the supposed orders of the Starfists, mercenaries and guards under the payroll of the Vivos Trading Company rounded up Rogerâ€™s crew and confiscated his goods. But the damage was done and a spark was made. Despite all the misinformation campaigns, threats, and purchasing of Shipwright companies, hundreds of ships were built for the sole purpose of transporting hundreds for many months across treacherous oceans for the chance of a new beginning in the new world. Despite a push back from multiple sources, the new world has already got a cult name of 'Rogerriches' The first wave of settlers left a month ago, the Starfists ordered blockades of all ports in response. It worked for a time, but the mass exodus of thousands of people could not be halted. Scaremongers on the boats fret that the old world will follow them one day. But the optimists look forward to the unknown, as what has come to be known as The March of Dreams; the name of the greatest exodus the realm has ever known, has left them with nothing but hope for a better life free from the decay and corruption of a broken realm
